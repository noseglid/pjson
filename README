== libpjson
pjson is a slim, and easy to use json interpreter for use in the c++ language.
The library and API is in place, but build process documentation and
other administrative tasks is still at hand.

Use with care so far.

== Dependencies
The boost library (headers only) is required to run libpjson

== Why?
There are several json interpreters out there, why would I go about
creating my own one? Several reasons:

* As an initial project, I did it to learn the basics of c++ and the boost library.
* The existing json interpreters had flaws I decided I could not accept. Among others where loads of valgrind warings, memory leaks and difficult to learn API.
